I'm sad to say that my React learning on this course was pretty surface level as my Design Sprint schedule changed and pretty much messed everything else up. I had to divide my meagre time outside of the thesis work between this course, another team work course and my translation work. As I didn't want to let my team down and I had to do my actual work work, this final project was left a bit on the wayside.
