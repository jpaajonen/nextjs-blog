Due to my other engagements I missed that the deadline for this project was pushed, but I can't say that I would have had the time or energy to make a video presentation. I did, however manage to add these two new blog posts at the final hour.

I want to thank you for the course, I enjoyed it immensly as the structure of the lesson plan supported learning very well. The same can be said about the all around atmosphere of the course; it was very inspiring and supportive. Easily the best programming course I've taken in Laurea.

Cheers!
